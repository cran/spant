\title{Frequency and phase corretion of MRS data in the time-domain.}
\usage{
fp_corr_td(mrs_data, ref = NULL, xlim = NULL, max_t = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{mrs_data}{MRS data to be corrected}

\item{ref}{optional MRS data to use as a reference, the first dynamic of
mrs_data is used if this argument is not supplied.}

\item{xlim}{optional frequency range to perform optimisation.}

\item{max_t}{truncate the FID when longer than max_t to reduce time taken}
}
\value{
a list containing the corrected data; phase and shift values in units
of degrees and Hz respectively.
}
\description{
An implementation of the method published by Near et al MRM 73:44-50 (2015).
